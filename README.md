# [jsonschema-form-for-material-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema-form-for-material-ui)

A [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) port of [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form).

[Project](https://github.com/alphaeadevelopment/material-ui-jsonschema-form) forked from [Graham King](https://github.com/alphaeadevelopment).

The forked project had a lot of stuff in it. This v2 is a full re-write of it. It uses [Mozilla's json schema form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) in it's base, and uses Material-UI components.
